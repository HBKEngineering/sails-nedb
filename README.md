# NeDB Adapter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adityamukho/sails-nedb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adityamukho/sails-nedb)

Waterline adapter for NeDB.

A persistent object store which uses [Node Embedded Database](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) as the storage engine.

## Caution

1. In case you run multiple sails workers on a machine as part of a load balancing strategy: NeDB is not designed to synchronize file writes across multiple concurrent processes. Running sails with more than 1 worker **WILL** eventually lead to inconsistent, and very likely corrupted data.
1. Updates are not atomic at the moment. Currently, an update actually happens in 3 stages:
    * A `find` query to return all documents matching update criteria. The ids of all returned documents are stored in a temporary array.
    * An `update` query, run with the provided criteria. NeDB currently does not return a list of the updated documents in this query - just the number of doc updated. (**Note:** this is NOT an upsert.)
    * A second `find` query, using the temp array of ids to return the list of modified documents.
Since the three separate queries are not part of a transaction, other queries could have been run in the meantime, altering the documents involved. For example, the set of docs returned by the first `find` and the set of docs actually modified by the `update` could be different because of an intervening `insert` or `remove` query.

## Installation

Install from NPM.

```bash
$ npm install sails-nedb --save
```

The NeDB dependency is actually pulled from my forked repo of the original, because I needed to add aggregation support at the DB layer. If and when [this pull request](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb/pull/153) gets merged into the main line, the dependendency will be switched back to the npm module.

## Sails Configuration

Add the nedb config to the `config/connections.js` file.
No special configuration is necessary. One can optionally set the `filePath` to point to a particular location. Files get saved to `.tmp` inside the application root by default.

## Acknowledgement

A big thanks to the contributors of **NeDB**, **sails-disk**, and **sails-mongo**. This adapter owes its existence in no small amount to each of these projects :).

## About Waterline
Waterline is a new kind of storage and retrieval engine.  It provides a uniform API for accessing stuff from different kinds of databases, protocols, and 3rd party APIs.  That means you write the same code to get users, whether they live in mySQL, LDAP, MongoDB, or Facebook.
